## Annotation Tools Analysis

- If you need full bounding boxes + tracking across video frames → go with CVAT.

- If you want custom workflows, event annotation, or multi-modal data + video → go with Label Studio.

- If you just need something quick/lightweight for smaller jobs → VIA or VIDAT.

- If your annotation is more about timestamps or behaviours (not object boxes) → PythonVideoAnnotator.
